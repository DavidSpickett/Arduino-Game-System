This is my second year design project. The module was based around the Arduino system and I chose to build a simple hand held game system using L.E.D. grids as displays.

Final report - full documentation of the project
parts.txt - parts list as exported from Eagle
Eagle Files - board layout and schematic created in Eagle
pong_PCB - the final demo application for the device, plays one or two player pong at a set speed.
scoll_text_PCB - a demo which scrolls a long piece of text across the displays.
Final board - a picture of the final assembled device
Final PCB - the final board layout
Final schematic - the final schematic for the system
Programming - the board begin programmed using an empty Arduino
Prototype hardware - the initial hardware for the system
Data Sheets - data sheets for the main components used
